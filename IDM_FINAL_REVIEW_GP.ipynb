The company wants to run TV ads promoting its cruises to high-income men, high-income women, and retirees. The company has decided to consider airing ads during prime-time, afternoon soap operas, and during the evening news. The number of exposures (in millions) expected to be generated by each type of ad in each of the companyâ€™s target audiences is summarized in the following table as well as the dataframe below."
